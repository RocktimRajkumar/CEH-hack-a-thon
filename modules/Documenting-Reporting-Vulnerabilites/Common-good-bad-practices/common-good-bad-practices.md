## Bad Practices to Avoid While Writing a Report

Here are a few bad practices we must avoid while writing a report:

- Avoid any spelling and grammatical errors/mistakes.
- Do not flood the report with too many irrelevant statistics.
- Do not write the report from a hacker's perspective as you cannot expect the reader to understand hacking concepts.
- Do not use screenshots in which the details are not clearly visible. To solve this issue, take multiple small screenshots of the same page instead of taking an extremely big screenshot.
- Never stretch images/screenshots that you are using in the report. Stretching the images/screenshots will make them distorted. So, if you want to make an image bigger, you can stretch it from the bottom right corner but not too much.
- Don't include and explain all the steps you did to get to the hack. In the report include the steps like initial payload that acts as a PoC (like showing the database name/version) and then show what all data you extracted (like usernames and passwords etc.). The steps followed in the middle are hacker centric and are not required in the report.

## Tool Kit
This kit contains a list of tools that are most commonly used by ethical hackers all around the world. 

Here is what the tool kit contains:

1. List of most commonly used tools.

2. What are these tools used for.

3. Links to use/download the tools.

4. Links of blogs, to read more about the tools. 

5. What language will be required to run the tool. 

So from now on, you are on a path of self learning. 

We would advise you to pick up one tool at a time. Read more about it online and understand what the tool does. 

Then download the tool and explore it. 

But be careful, do not use these tools in an unethical manner. 

Happy Exploring!
